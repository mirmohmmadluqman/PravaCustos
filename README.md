# Prava Custos

## Overview
**Prava Custos** is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to create and manage private entities (e.g., companies or ownership claims) with provable ownership, prioritizing privacy and simplicity.

Users can:
- Store encrypted data off-chain using **IPFS**
- Link that data to an on-chain smart contract
- Prove ownership using a password or cryptographic key

The platform ensures **anonymity**, requiring **no KYC** or public identities. It uses **AES encryption** and **keccak256 hashing** for security.

## Our/My Aim:

 - Decentralized Identity & Trust System
 - Anonymous Legal Company Ownership System
 - Post-Quantum Cryptography
---

## Features

- **Entity Creation**: Create a private entity with a unique ID. Store encrypted data (e.g., company details) on IPFS and password hash on-chain.
- **Ownership Proof**: Enter password → hash → compare with on-chain → decrypt if correct.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Change the password and encrypted data to transfer ownership securely.
- **Privacy Focused**: No personal identity or KYC required. Ownership is proven cryptographically.
